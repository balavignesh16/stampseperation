Stamp Detection Using Deep Learning

Overview

This project aims to develop a deep learning model to recognize and detect stamps in documents. The implementation is carried out using Google Colab and leverages deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

Features

Detection of stamps in scanned or digital documents

Training from scratch using a custom dataset

Image pre-processing and augmentation for better model generalization

Real-time inference on new documents

Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.10

Google Colab

PyTorch

TensorFlow

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

scikit-learn

Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone <https://github.com/balavignesh16/stampseperation>

Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Install necessary dependencies using:

!pip install torch torchvision tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

Dataset Preparation

The dataset should contain images of documents with stamps.

Annotations should be provided in a format compatible with training (e.g., COCO, YOLO, or bounding box coordinates in CSV/JSON).

Data augmentation techniques can be applied for improved performance.

Model Training

The training script preprocesses the dataset, applies augmentations, and trains a deep learning model.

The model architecture is based on CNNs and pre-trained networks like U-Net or Faster R-CNN.

Training logs and loss graphs are generated for performance monitoring.

Inference

After training, the model can be used to detect stamps in new images.

The inference pipeline includes image pre-processing and visualization of detected stamps.

Results

The model evaluation is based on metrics like precision, recall, and mAP.

Sample outputs are provided for reference.

Future Improvements

Fine-tuning with larger datasets.

Integration with OCR for document text recognition.

Deployment as a web application for real-time usage.
